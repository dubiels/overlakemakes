üì£ Imagine it, design it, create it.
===================================

Have you ever dreamed of creatingn your aircraft? WA-050 is bringing a unique opportunity to learn how to work with OpenVSP, flight software used by NASA to create air and spacecraft models. Within 40 hours, students will go from complete beginners to having created their very own aircraft - *being able to imagine a concept and model it virtually.* {#subpadding .lead}

üåé Skills and Lessons
====================

\

Cadets will be led through instruction and lessons to ensure they are
familiar with the software and concepts before they are given project
prompts and begin working on their projects. Through allowing cadets to
learn a new concept quckly in a supportive environment, we ensure that
they will walk away with:

-   ** Understanding of the principles of aircraft modeling and design
-   ** Knowledge of how to work with OpenVSP, a NASA software
-   ** Preparation for hackathons and makeathons
-   ** Strong virtual teamwork & collaboration skills

üèÜ Prizes & Awards {hd="white"}
