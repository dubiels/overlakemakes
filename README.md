Have you ever dreamed of creating your own aircraft? WA-050 is bringing a unique opportunity to learn how to work with OpenVSP, flight software used by NASA to create air and spacecraft models. Within 40 hours, students will go from complete beginners to having created their very own aircraft - being able to imagine a concept and model it virtually.
